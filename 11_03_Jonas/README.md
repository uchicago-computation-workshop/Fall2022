**Summary:** There is a popular belief in neuroscience that we are primarily data limited, that producing large, multimodal, and complex datasets will, enabled by data analysis algorithms, lead to fundamental insights into the way the brain processes information. Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors.  Here we take a simulated classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information.  We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the processor.  This suggests that current computational approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful models of the brain. We discuss several obvious shortcomings with this model, and ways that they might be addressed, both experimentally and computationally.

**Attendance**: The presentation will be held in Rm 107 of Kent Hall.

**Participation**: Students in the Masters of Computational Social Science program are expected to attend and join the discussion by posting a comment on the first issues page of the workshop’s public repository.

**Before the first meeting**, by Wednesday, October 26 @ 11:59pm each of you will:

Comment a well-developed question or comment about the reading for this week’s workshop on the public repository.

If you would really like to ask your question in person, please place two exclamation points before your question to signal that you really want to ask it.

Upvote (“thumbs up”) questions and proposals from other people. Upvote questions and recommendations you like (not comments from people you are friends with ;-). There may be prizes for top question askers.
</p>

This week's suggested readings:

- [Eric Jonas (2017) Could a Neuroscientist Understand a Microprocessor?](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268)

- [Then there is criticism of the paper at Pub Peer, some of it quite good!](https://pubpeer.com/publications/D157C28CD8E33466315A9AFEF38A5B)

- [Krakauer had a nice similar note on behavior](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.12.041)
