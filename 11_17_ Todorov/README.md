**Summary:** People form instantaneous impressions from facial appearance, agree on these impressions, and act on these impressions. In the past 15 years, we have introduced data-driven computational methods that allow us to visualize the configurations of facial features that lead to specific social inferences (e.g., perceived trustworthiness). That is, we are able to visualize appearance stereotypes and identify their perceptual basis. Extending this work, using generative adversarial networks and large data sets (> 1 million judgments), we have created models capable of generating and manipulating the appearance of hyper-realistic faces. These AI models of human judgment biases can generate large sets of faces parametrically manipulated on perceived social dimensions and score existing face images on these dimensions. As such, they are an excellent tool for social science research. However, because models of impressions are based on aggregated judgments, they mask stable individual differences in judgments. In fact, for almost any complex impression, statistical modeling shows that stable idiosyncratic preferences contribute to more than 50% of the variance. We are currently working on building models of idiosyncratic impressions.
