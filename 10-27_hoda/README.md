**Summary:** Hybrid human-ML teams are increasingly in charge of consequential decisions in various domains. A growing body of empirical and theoretical work has advanced our understanding of these systems. However, existing empirical results are mixed, and theoretical proposals are often mutually incompatible. In this work, we propose a unifying framework for understanding conditions under which combining the complementary strengths of humans and ML leads to higher quality decisions than those produced by each of them individually—a state which we refer to as human-ML complementarity. We focus specifically on the context of human-ML predictive decision-making and investigate optimal ways of combining human and ML predictive decisions, accounting for the underlying sources of variation in their judgments. Within this scope, we present two contributions. First, taking a computational perspective of decision-making and drawing upon prior literature in psychology, machine learning, and human-computer interaction, we introduce a taxonomy characterizing a wide range of criteria across which human and machine decision-making differ. Second, formalizing our taxonomy allows us to study how human and ML predictive decisions should be aggregated optimally. We show that our proposed framework encompasses several existing models of human-ML complementarity as special cases. Last but not least, an initial exploratory analysis of our framework presents a critical insight for future work in human-ML complementarity: the mechanism by which we combine human and ML judgments should be informed by the underlying causes of divergence in their decisions.

**Attendance**: The presentation will be held in Rm 107 of Kent Hall. MACSS students are required to attend this week’s presentation in-person.

**Participation**: Students in the Masters of Computational Social Science program are expected to attend and join the discussion by posting a comment on the first issues page of the workshop’s public repository.

**Before the first meeting**, by Wednesday, October 26 @ 11:59pm each of you will:

Comment a well-developed question or comment about the reading for this week’s workshop on the public repository.

If you would really like to ask your question in person, please place two exclamation points before your question to signal that you really want to ask it.

Upvote (“thumbs up”) questions and proposals from other people. Upvote questions and recommendations you like (not comments from people you are friends with ;-). There may be prizes for top question askers.
